I am Ilze from Riga and feel quite lost in IT world for now. I like Python better than Java, because it is more similar to Excel that is my main friend at work. Todays lesson was quite doable. But not all lessons are like that.

I am Anett and i feel like I now so much, but so little in the same time. Feel anxiety about the employment market. I like Java more, because it is written out more, lots of shortcuts in phyton, my brain does not proccess this well.

Hello! I am Anastasia from Estonia. I am struggling to find my way in IT, cause both Java and Phyton are quite challanging for me. There are topics which I understand good and topics which are quite hard to process. But I have still hope that I can make it.
