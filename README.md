I am Ilze from Riga and feel quite lost in IT world for now. I like Python better than Java, because it is more similar to Excel that is my main friend at work. Todays lesson was quite doable. But not all lessons are like that.

Hello! I am Anastasia from Estonia. I am struggling to find my way in IT, cause both Java and Phyton are quite challanging for me. There are topics which I understand good and topics which are quite hard to process. But I have still hope that I can make it.
